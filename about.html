              <h2>Education</h2>
              <p>My name is Dean Frangas and I am a junior at SUNY New Paltz. I am a computer science major and I hope to pursue it as a job after college.
                A little bit about me: I often go to the gym and have been for many years now, I like to read and am currently on the game of thrones series, and I like to listen to new music whenever I can

          <h2>Computer engineering</h2>
          <p>I have found my passion and interest in computers from a young age when I helped my mom out with her job as a IT consultant. I often would go to job sites with her and I would learn about how computers worked.</p>
          <p>Eventually this passion stemmed into what I major in now, and it is something that I hope I can build a career off of in the future.</p>
